    <h1>CSS Display</h1>
    <h4>
      The CSS display property is used to define the rendering behavior of an
      element in terms of its box type and layout. It determines how an element
      is displayed on the web page. The display property can take various
      values, each affecting the element's layout and interactions differently.
    </h4>

    <h2>1. display: block</h2>

    <h4>
      block: The element generates a block-level box, which means it starts on a
      new line and stretches the full width of its containing element. Example:
      div, p, h1,
    </h4>

    <div class="common-div div-box">Div Box 0 ;display: block;</div>

    <span> Above div box width 50% only, but its take the entire line</span>
    <h2>2. Display inline</h2>
    <div class="common-div div-box-1">Div Box - 1 ; display: inline;</div>

    <span>
      Display inline : The element generates an inline-level box, which means it
      does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as
      necessary.(height & width not affect). tags default inline display
      Examples are: span, a, strong
    </span>

    <h2>3. Display inline-block</h2>
    <div class="common-div div-box-2">Div Box - 2 ; display: inline-block;</div>
    <span
      >The element generates an inline-level box, but it behaves as a
      block-level element regarding its layout. It doesn't start on a new line
      and can have width and height properties.
    </span>
    <div class="container"></div>
    <h2>4. Display none</h2>
    <div class="common-div div-box-3">Div Box - 3; display: none;</div>
    <span
      >The element is not displayed at all, making it effectively invisible and
      taking up no space in the layout. This is often used for hiding and
      showing elements dynamically using JavaScript.
    </span>
    <div class="container"></div>
    <h2>5. Display flex</h2>
    <div class="common-div div-box-4">Div Box - 4; display: flex;</div>
    <span
      >The element becomes a flex container, and its children become flex items.
      This allows for flexible layouts with the ability to easily control the
      arrangement of items along the main and cross axes.
    </span>
    <h2>6. Display grid</h2>
    <div class="container"></div>
    <div class="common-div div-box-5">Div Box - 5; display: grid;</div>
    <span
      >The element becomes a grid container, and its children become grid items.
      This allows for a two-dimensional layout system, providing both rows and
      columns.
    </span>
